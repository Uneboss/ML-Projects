# Pima Indian Diabetes Classification using Neural Networks

Pima indian diabetes dataset problem using keras and sequential neural network in google colaboratory

Information of dataset columns:
Col1 = Pregnancies, number of times pregnant

Col2 = Glucose, Plasma glulcose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

Col3 = Blood Pressure, Diastolic bood pressure (mmHg)

Col4 = Skin Thickness, Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Col5 = Insulin, 2-hour serum insulin (muU/ml)

Col6 = BMI, Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

Col7 = Diabetes Pedigree Function

Col8 = Age (years)

Col9 = Outcome class variable (0 or 1)


Model used:

Sequential dense neural networks with dropout, rmsprop optimization, and binary cross-entorpy loss
